## Asset Trading: Breaking Chain Barriers, One-Stop Access to Global Assets

UXUY leverages its proprietary cross-chain trading protocol to support major public chains such as Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Base, Solana, and more. It completely breaks down inter-chain barriers, enabling a seamless multi-chain asset trading experience.

No matter which chain the assets are deployed on, UXUY achieves direct cross-chain access and instant execution, making multi-chain asset trading as efficient and convenient as single-chain operations.

### Fee Policy:

- A 1% service fee is charged on all transaction amounts
- Discounted 0.5% service fee applies to mainstream assets (e.g., ETH, BTC, USDT)
- Single transaction fee capped at $99
